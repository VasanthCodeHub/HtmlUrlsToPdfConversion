        summary="Overdraw: Painting regions more than once"
        explanation="If you set a background drawable on a root view, then you should use a custom theme where the theme background is null. Otherwise, the theme background will be painted first, only to have your custom background completely cover it; this is called &quot;overdraw&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;NOTE: This detector relies on figuring out which layouts are associated with which activities based on scanning the Java code, and it&apos;s currently doing that using an inexact pattern matching algorithm. Therefore, it can incorrectly conclude which activity the layout is associated with and then wrongly complain that a background-theme is hidden.&#xA;&#xA;If you want your custom background on multiple pages, then you should consider making a custom theme with your custom background and just using that theme instead of a root element background.&#xA;&#xA;Of course it&apos;s possible that your custom drawable is translucent and you want it to be mixed with the background. However, you will get better performance if you pre-mix the background with your drawable and use that resulting image or color as a custom theme background instead."

        explanation="Specify an `autofillHints` attribute when targeting SDK version 26 or higher or explicitly specify that the view is not important for autofill. Your app can help an autofill service classify the data correctly by providing the meaning of each view that could be autofillable, such as views representing usernames, passwords, credit card fields, email addresses, etc.&#xA;&#xA;The hints can have any value, but it is recommended to use predefined values like &apos;username&apos; for a username or &apos;creditCardNumber&apos; for a credit card number. For a list of all predefined autofill hint constants, see the `AUTOFILL_HINT_` constants in the `View` reference at https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html.&#xA;&#xA;You can mark a view unimportant for autofill by specifying an `importantForAutofill` attribute on that view or a parent view.

In this case, set their descriptions to `@null`. If your app&apos;s minSdkVersion is 16 or higher, you can instead set these graphical elements&apos; `android:importantForAccessibility` attributes to `no`.&#xA;&#xA;Note that for text fields, you should not set both the `hint` and the `contentDescription` attributes since the hint will never be shown.
